# EEE4121F: Module B Lab 1
The steps below explain how to replicate the results from the experiment and where to find the results:

1. Run "chmod +x tcp.py" to compile the tcp.py file
2. Run "chmod +x run.sh" to compile the run.sh shell file
3. Run "sudo ./run.sh" to run all the experiments
4. Find the results in the bwhost_100, qsize_100 and qsize_20. Where bwhost_100 is when the host bandwidth is set to 100 Mbps, qsize_100 is when the queue size is set to 20 and qsize_100 is when the queue size is set to 100.
